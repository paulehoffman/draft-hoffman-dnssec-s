    <abstract>


<t>DNSSEC as defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 is based on authenticated
messages.
That design has allowed DNSSEC to be deployed at the upper levels of the DNS
tree, but operational issues with message-based authentication has caused lower
levels fo the DNS tree to mostly forego DNSSEC.
This document extends DNSSEC with a second type of authentication, based on
session authentication from TLS, that is easier to deploy by some (but
certainly not all) authoritative DNS servers.
The goal is to have many more zones be DNSSEC-enabled.</t>

<t>Note that this document does <spanx style="emph">not</spanx> replace current DNSSEC.
A validating resolver needs to implement all of traditional DNSSEC, and might
also implement the protocol defined here. 
A server might protect the contents of DNS zones for which it is authoritative
with traditional DNSSEC, with the protocol defined here, or both.
The protocol defined here is only useful for some authoritative servers,
and is explicitly not useful for others.</t>

<t>***
Notice for -00
***</t>

<t>This -00 draft is meant to engender discussion, particularly to find out if
there is a good use case for this proposal. This draft is definitely not
considered ready for consideration in an IETF WG.</t>

<section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">

<t>As stated in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, “The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
add data origin authentication and data integrity to the Domain Name System”.
The protocol described in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>, and <xref target="RFC4035"/> provide
those services by adding new resource records and specifying how to
cryptographically validate the contents of those records.
In this document, DNSSEC as defined in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>, <xref target="RFC4035"/> and
all RFCs that update those three is called “DNSSEC-M”.
The designation “-M” means “message”: those RFCs define secure message-based
authentication for DNS messages.</t>

<t>This document defines a second type of DNSSEC that can be used alongside
DNSSEC-M. This second type uses secure session-based authentication using TLS.
It is called “DNSSEC-S”, where “-S” means “session”. In short, DNSSEC-S allows
the validating resolver to authenticate the origin of the DNS data because it
comes directly from the authoritative server during a TLS session; the TLS
session also provides data integrity.
DNSSEC-S clients and servers MUST use TLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/>.</t>

<t>The protocol described in this document provides a mechanism could encourage
many more organizations, particularly large organizations that already run
secure web services, to enable DNSSEC on their zones.</t>

<section anchor="UseCases" title="Use Cases">

<t>Deploying DNSSEC-M has proven successful in some environments, but not in
others. At the time this document is published, the root of the DNS tree is
secured with DNSSEC-M, as are many of the TLDs in the root. However, only a few
major content providers have signed their zones with DNSSEC-M.</t>

<t>When asked why they don’t sign their zones, these content providers give various
reasons, but one major reason stands out.
The software that is used to sign zones for DNSSEC-M is often described as
“complicated” and “fragile”. If a zone is not properly signed before it is
published by the authoritative server, parts or all of the zone may become
unavailable to recursive resolvers that perform DNSSEC-M validation.
Further, the signing software must be run periodically and the results must
be correct; otherwise, the zone becomes unavailable and may stay that way
for days even after the problem is discovered.</t>

<t>Content providers say that the risk of their zone becoming unavailable due
to the above problems with DNSSEC-M (as well as other issues) is not worth
the positive attributes of DNSSEC-M, and therefore leave their zones unsigned.</t>

<t>If a system can definitively eliminate this risk while introducing
only much smaller risks, some content providers might consider authenticating their
zones with DNSSEC. DNSSEC-S proposes to be such a system.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="use-cases-not-considered-here" title="Use Cases Not Considered Here">

<t>DNSSEC-S uses TLS for session security, and TLS also provides encryption of
sessions. However, the encrypted aspect of DNSSEC-S sessions is explicitly
not considered a use case for DNSSEC-S.
DNSSEC-S is not appropriate for all authoritative servers, so the encryption
that comes as part of DNSSEC-S should only be considered a useful side-benefit,
not a primary use case.
The DPRIVE Working Group in the IETF is currently considering mechanisms to
encrypt communications with authoritative servers.</t>

<t>The security of DNSSEC-S relies on keeping the TLS private key secret.
Because of this, DNSSEC-S is not appropriate for DNSSEC-protected zones where
the nameservers are run by multiple organizations that have different abilities
to protect a private key. 
As an obvious example, the DNS root is currently served by many hundreds of
different organizations that run instances of the root zone. 
Because it is impossible to serve the current DNS using just DNSSEC-S, this
document mandates that validating resolvers MUST support validating with
DNSSEC-M if they also support validating with DNSSEC-S.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
<xref target="RFC2119"/> and indicate requirement levels for compliant CBOR
implementations.</t>

<t>This document creates two new terms, “DNSSEC-M” and “DNSSEC-S”. See <xref target="Intro"/>
for their definition. It also creates associated terms, “DS hash set” in
<xref target="ClientPrep"/> and “certificate hash set” in <xref target="AuthOfSession"/>.</t>

<t>A great deal of other DNSSEC-related terminology can be found in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis"/>.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="protocol-description" title="Protocol Description">

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">

<t>A DNS client that wants authenticated answers to queries (such as a
Security-Aware Recursive Name Server, a Security-Aware Resolver, or a
Security-Aware Stub Resolver) can detect that an authoritative server is using
DNSSEC-S when it gets the DS records for that authoritative server from the
parent zone.
If one or more of those DS records have a digest type of DS-DIGEST-TBD,
then the client can assume that the authoritative
server speaks DNS over TLS as defined in this document, and that the TLS session
can be authenticated with the contents of the DS record.</t>

<t>After a TLS session is established, the DNS client and the server speak the
normal DNS protocol (using the two-octet length extension for TCP) described in
<xref target="RFC1035"/>, except that the messages go in the TLS connection, not over UDP or
TCP. The DNS client treats all authoritative responses from the server as
authenticated because they are received in the TLS session.</t>

<t>DNSSEC-S does not have the problems listed for DNSSEC-M listed in <xref target="UseCases"/>.
There is no DNS-specific cryptography in DNSSEC-S; instead, it relies on TLS
cryptography which is already well understood.
There is no need to sign anything in a zone or to maintain the zone signing keys.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="service-discovery-and-authentication-through-a-new-ds-type" title="Service Discovery and Authentication Through a New DS Type">

<t>A DNSSEC-S client discovers that an authoritative server supports DNSSEC-S
by querying the authoritative server’s parent for the DS record set, and
noting if any of the DS records are in the format given here.
There is a DNSSEC-S DS record in the parent for each TLS certificate that the
authoritative server might present when serving DNSSEC-S.</t>

<t>The DS record in the parent zone for DNSSEC-S has the same format as other
DS records, but the values in some of the fields are different.
For DNSSEC-S, the values MUST be:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Key Tag – 0</t>
  <t>Algorithm – The signing algorithm of the TLS certificate</t>
  <t>Digest Type – DS-DIGEST-TBD</t>
  <t>Digest – The SHA-256 <xref target="SHA256"/> hash of the authenticating public key in the TLS certificate</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="ClientPrep" title="Client Preparation Before Establishing a TLS Connection">

<t>The client validates the DS resource record set in the parent for a zone; if the resource
record set does not validate, the client MUST NOT use DNSSEC-S to authenticate
values in the zone.</t>

<t>The client starts a dataset called the “DS hash set”. Each member of the dataset consists
of a hash value obtained from the DS records that have Digest Type DS-DIGEST-TBD.
DS records with Digest Type other than DS-DIGEST-TBD MUST NOT be used to create the DS hash set.</t>

<t>If the DS hash set is empty, the client MUST NOT attempt to establish a
TLS connection.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="establishing-the-tls-session" title="Establishing the TLS Session">

<t>The client chooses a record from the DS hash set and starts a TLS session on port 443 with the
server at one of the IP addresses from the record. Both client and server MUST
use TLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/>.</t>

<t>***</t>

<t>There are two proposals for how to connect to the TLS server: on port 443
using ALPN <xref target="RFC7301"/> and ALPN identifier ALPN-TBD, or on port PORT-TBD (a new port).
Both proposals have the same cryptographic properties, and almost identical
properties for middleboxes.
One or the other needs to be chosen during the discussion of this protocol.</t>

<t>***</t>

<t>Depending on the choice made, one of the following statements will be made in
the protocol.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The client MUST identify the session with ALPN using ALPN-TBD
as an identifier to establish the TLS session.</t>
  <t>The client MUST use port PORT-TBD to establish the TLS session.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The registration for one or the other appear in <xref target="ianacons"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="AuthOfSession" title="Authenticating the TLS Session">

<t>The client receives the TLS Certificates message from the server.
Note that the Certificate message might contain one or more raw public keys
(described in <xref target="RFC7250"/>.
For each certificate in the Certificates message, the client hashes the
public key in the certificate with SHA-256 and adds it to a
dataset called the “certificate hash set”.</t>

<t>The client then compares the the first element from the DS hash set to the
elements in the certificate hash set.
If there is a match, the certificate associated with that hash is considered
authenticated for TLS. If there is no match, the client compares each
of the remaining elements from the DS hash set, searching for a match.</t>

<t>If there is no match for any element in the DS hash set in the
certificate hash set, the client MUST terminate the connection with an authentication failure
as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/>.
In this case, the client MUST NOT use DNSSEC-S with this server for this session,
and SHOULD NOT try again to use DNSSEC-S with that server until the signature on the DS
resource record set has expired.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="continuing-the-authenticated-session" title="Continuing the Authenticated Session">

<t>After a TLS session is established, the DNS client and the server speak the
normal DNS protocol (using the two-octet length extension for TCP) described in
<xref target="RFC1035"/>, except that the messages go in the TLS connection, not over UDP or
TCP. The DNS client treats all authoritative responses from the server as
authenticated because they are received in the TLS session.</t>

<section anchor="updates-to-rfc-4033-4034-and-4035" title="Updates to RFC 4033, 4034, and 4035">

<t>***
This section will list specific textual updates to the base DNSSEC-M RFCs to
allow for DNSSEC-S. The section might get long; if so, it will be broken into
sub-sections for easier commenting.
This section is a placeholder for later drafts if this work is adopted.
***</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Any authoritative answer from an authoritative server is considered validated
if it was obtained with DNSSEC-S. <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5 (and maybe 4?).
Non-authoritative answers are not considered validated. This will need
a careful list of restrictions (Answer section, AA bit set, …).</t>
  <t>A DS record with Digest Type DS-DIGEST-TBD MUST NOT be used for chaining with
DNSKEY records. <xref target="RFC4034"/> Section 5.</t>
  <t>There are probably other updates.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="additional-considerations" title="Additional Considerations">

<section anchor="effect-of-dnssec-s-on-resolvers-that-only-validate-with-dnssec-m" title="Effect of DNSSEC-S on Resolvers that Only Validate with DNSSEC-M">

<t>DNSSEC-S is designed to not affect resolvers that only validate with DNSSEC-M.
The choice of using DS-DIGEST-TBD in the DS record in the parent will cause
a resolver that only knows about DNSSEC-M to think that the child zone is
unsigned. Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> says that the following must hold:</t>

<t>“The Algorithm and Key Tag in the DS RR match the Algorithm field
and the key tag of a DNSKEY RR in the child zone’s apex DNSKEY
RRset, and, when the DNSKEY RR’s owner name and RDATA are hashed
using the digest algorithm specified in the DS RR’s Digest Type
field, the resulting digest value matches the Digest field of the
DS RR.”</t>

<t>A validator that only knows DNSSEC-M will not know how to hash 
“using the digest algorithm specified in the DS RR’s Digest Type
field” because it will not know the algorithm for DS-DIGEST-TBD.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="simultaneous-use-of-both-dnssec-m-and-dnssec-s" title="Simultaneous Use of Both DNSSEC-M and DNSSEC-S">

<t>An authoritative server that uses DNSSEC-S for authentication can also use DNSSEC-M
if it wishes.
That is, such a server can still answer queries with the DO bit set just as it
would have if the queries came over UDP or TCP instead of over TLS.
In order to do this, the authoritative server would need at least two DS records in its
parent’s zone, one for DNSSEC-M and one for DNSSEC-S.</t>

<t>Similarly, a DNS client that is using DNSSEC-S can still request DNSSEC-M records
(using the DO bit) and process them as it would if those records were received over UDP or TCP
(or out of band). A DNS client may successfully establishes a DNSSEC-S session
and receive DNSSEC-M responses that do not validate; the result of such a situation
is explicitly undefined in this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="standby-keys" title="Standby Keys">

<t>An authoritative server can deploy standby keys whose private keys are not in
production. To do this, they simply add NS records whose DNSSEC NS Label is the
hash of the not-yet-operational public key, and the A or AAAA records for that
name point to the same servers as the operational NS records.</t>

<t>This scheme will make validators that use DNSSEC-S to be slightly slower because
they need to perform one extra decoding per standby key, and possibly one extra SHA-256
hash execution per comparison with certificates from the TLS server.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>***
This section will clearly be much longer before the document is finished.
Proposed additions are welcome.
***</t>

<t>An authoritative server that supports both DNSSEC-S and DNSSEC-M, and sends
DNSSEC-M records that cause the authoritative answers to not validate in
DNSSEC-M, will likely have nondeterministic results when queried.</t>

<t>The security of DNSSEC-S is dependent on the ability of DNSSEC-S clients to
correctly match the public keys in the TLS certificate messages with the values
in the DNSSEC-S NS Labels. A DNSSEC-S client that mis-implements the rules in
this protocol will be capable of being fooled into validating answers that it
should not.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ianacons" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>***
If ALPN is chosen, a template for registering ALPN-TBD will go here. However, if
a new port is chosen, a template for registering port PORT-TBD will go here.
Only one of these two registrations will appear here.
***</t>

<t>***
The template for registering DS-DIGEST-TBD will go here.
